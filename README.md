This is a collection of some basic scripts I have created for customer demonstrations on the use cases for the Mist API. 

NONE OF THESE SHOULD BE USED IN PRODUCTION

You will need to install the following modules

pip install websockets
pip install python-dotenv

You will also need to create a file to store your specifc variables 

#creds.env template
API_TOKEN="Add you API Token"

ORD_ID="Add Your Org ID"

SITE_ID="Add your Site ID"
